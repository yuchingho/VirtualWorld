   Imprudence isn't just a project for programmers. No matter your
   skills (or lack thereof) or how much time you can commit, there's
   a way for you to be a part of it.


 EVERYBODY AND THEIR GRANDMAS

   Here are some good ways anybody can help out:

     * Let us know what you think needs to be improved about the SL
       Viewer.

     * Participate in discussions on the forums or mailing list.
       (Visit ImprudenceViewer.org for links to both of those.)

     * Try out the Imprudence Viewer (when it's released) and give
       feedback about it.

     * Watch a friend, family member, or co-worker to try SL for the
       first time, and take notes about the things they find difficult
       or confusing.

     * Blog about the latest Imprudence news and developments (either
       on the ImprudenceViewer.org blog or your own).

     * Help organize and coordinate other volunteers to keep things
       running smoothly.

     * Tell a friend and get them involved too!


 ARTISTS, DESIGNERS, AND UI FREAKS

   If you happen to have some graphics skill or an interest in User
   Interface design, here are some things you could do:

     * Work with users to turn their ideas into something people can
       look at.

     * Make a sketch or Flash mock-up of how some part of the UI
       should behave, look, or be organized.

     * Offer suggestions and constructive criticism about other
       people's designs.

     * Create or improve a color scheme or skin for the Viewer.

     * Paint some graphics or icons for a UI-in-progress.

     * Hook up with a programmer and turn your design into a real,
       working interface!


 CODE MONKEYS AND TEKKIE-WIKIS

   Of course, there's always plenty for programmers and other
   tech-savvy people to do:

     * Compile a Viewer branch for other people to download and test.

     * Try out a patch to make sure it applies cleanly, and make a Git
       branch so others can easily merge the changes.

     * Clean up or add comments/documentation for part of the source
       code.

     * Fix a bug or optimize a slow piece of code.

     * Work with a designer to bring a UI concept to life!


 OTHER REALLY COOL PEOPLE

   We're also looking for people who can help with:

     * Accessibility. We'd love to make it easier for people with
       disabilities to have a functional and satisfying SL experience,
       but we need people with the knowledge and experience to help us
       identify the biggest hurdles and find solutions.

     * Localization & Translation. Many of the non-English UI
       translations are awkward or wrong, but only someone who knows
       the language can make them better. If you are fluent in both
       English and another tongue, please help us add or improve the
       translation for your language.


 GOT ANOTHER IDEA?

   There are many more ways to get involved than we could list here;
   and there are surely some good ones that you can think of, but that
   we hadn't! Don't hesitate to contact us if you'd like to help
   out, even if it's not listed here!
